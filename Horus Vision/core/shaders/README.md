# Shader Management Module for Horus Vision

This module, consisting of `hrs_shader_manager.cpp`, `hrs_shader_manager.h`, and various shader files (`light.frag`, `light.vert`, `shader.frag`, `shader.vert`), provides a comprehensive solution for shader program management in the Horus Vision rendering engine.

## Features

- **Shader Compilation and Linking**: Automates the process of compiling vertex and fragment shaders, linking them into shader programs for use in rendering.
- **Dynamic Shader Loading**: Facilitates the runtime loading and compilation of shaders, allowing for dynamic updates and customization.
- **Resource Optimization**: Ensures efficient management of shader resources, minimizing overhead and maximizing rendering performance.

## Usage

1. Include `hrs_shader_manager.h` in your rendering pipeline.
2. Utilize the Shader Manager to load, compile, and link shader programs from the provided `.vert` and `.frag` files.
3. Apply shader programs to rendering objects and scenes for dynamic lighting and other effects.

## Support

For detailed usage instructions and support, refer to the inline documentation within the source and shader files. Additional assistance can be sought by contacting the project maintainer directly.
