# Advanced Scene Management for Horus Vision

This suite of modules, including grid management, importer workflows, and scene orchestration, forms the backbone of the Horus Vision project's scene architecture. It provides developers with sophisticated tools for spatial organization, efficient model importation, and dynamic scene management.

## Modules Overview

### Grid System (`hrs_grid.cpp`, `hrs_grid.h`)
Handles spatial partitioning and organization, facilitating efficient object placement, visibility calculations, and collision detection within scenes.

### Importer Manager (`hrs_importer_manager.cpp`, `hrs_importer_manager.h`)
Streamlines the process of importing 3D models and assets into the engine from various formats, ensuring compatibility and optimizing loading times.

### Scene and Scene Manager (`hrs_scene.cpp`, `hrs_scene.h`, `hrs_scene_manager.cpp`, `hrs_scene_manager.h`)
Orchestrates all elements within a scene, from managing lifecycles of objects to handling interactions and rendering states, ensuring a cohesive and dynamic environment.

## Integration and Usage

1. **Grid System**: Include and utilize the grid system for managing spatial aspects of your scenes, improving performance and interaction handling.
2. **Importer Manager**: Leverage the importer manager for seamless asset integration, supporting a wide range of model formats.
3. **Scene Management**: Use the scene and scene manager modules to control the overall structure and behavior of scenes, from initialization to runtime modifications.
