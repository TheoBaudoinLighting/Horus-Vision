# Detailed Horus Vision Utilities README

This directory encompasses a suite of utility modules that underpin the operation of the Horus Vision project, offering sophisticated logging, configuration, and system resource management functionalities among others. These utilities are engineered to enhance the robustness, performance, and maintainability of the project.

## Detailed Modules Overview

### Logging System

- **Files**: `hrs_logger.cpp`, `hrs_logger.h`
- **Functionality**: Implements a comprehensive logging system designed to track application operations, errors, and system diagnostics. It supports various log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and can be configured to output logs to different destinations (console, file, network).
- **Usage**: Integrate the logger by including `hrs_logger.h` in your application modules. Use the provided macros or functions to log messages throughout your application.

### Platform-Specific Definitions

- **File**: `hrs_platform.h`
- **Functionality**: Contains macros and definitions tailored to different operating systems and platforms, ensuring that Horus Vision can operate across various environments without requiring code changes.
- **Usage**: Automatically included where platform-specific operations or checks are necessary. It helps in writing platform-agnostic code in other parts of the application.

### Buffer Reset Utilities

- **File**: `hrs_reset_buffers.h`
- **Functionality**: Offers functions to reset and clear various internal and graphical buffers, crucial for maintaining application state and preventing memory leaks.
- **Usage**: Employ these utilities in scene changes or when releasing resources to ensure clean transitions and optimal memory usage.

### Performance Timing

- **File**: `hrs_timer.h`
- **Functionality**: A high-resolution timer utility for measuring execution times of code segments, aiding in performance optimization and debugging.
- **Usage**: Include `hrs_timer.h` in performance-critical sections to benchmark and log execution times.

### General Utilities

- **File**: `hrs_utils.h`
- **Functionality**: Provides a collection of miscellaneous utility functions and macros, such as mathematical operations, data conversion, and more, to support various operational needs.
- **Usage**: Leverage these utilities to simplify common coding tasks and enhance code readability and efficiency.

### Configuration Management

- **File**: `hrs_config.h`
- **Functionality**: Centralized configuration management header, including global definitions, feature flags, and settings that dictate application behavior.
- **Usage**: Update this file to modify global settings or feature toggles across the application.

### Application Context Management

- **File**: `hrs_context.h`
- **Functionality**: Manages the global application context, holding state, configurations, and operational parameters accessible throughout the project.
- **Usage**: Access or modify the application context to reflect changes in application state or configurations.

### Garbage Collection

- **File**: `hrs_garbage_collector.h`
- **Functionality**: Implements a garbage collection system for managing and disposing of unused or stale resources dynamically, ensuring efficient resource use and application performance.
- **Usage**: Integrate with resource-allocation mechanisms to automatically manage the lifecycle of objects and data.

## Integration and Support

These modules are designed for easy integration, offering interfaces and documentation comments for guidance. For detailed integration steps, usage examples, and support, please refer to the inline documentation within each file or contact the project maintainer directly.
