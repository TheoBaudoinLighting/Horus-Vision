# Importer and Mesh Management Module for Horus Vision

This module consists of `hrs_importer.cpp`, `hrs_importer.h`, `hrs_mesh.cpp`, and `hrs_mesh.h`, focusing on the importation and management of mesh data in the Horus Vision rendering engine.

## Module Overview

- `hrs_importer.cpp` & `hrs_importer.h`: These files implement the functionality to import 3D models from various file formats, parsing and preparing them for rendering within Horus Vision.
- `hrs_mesh.cpp` & `hrs_mesh.h`: Responsible for defining and managing mesh data, including vertices, edges, and faces, along with their associated properties like textures and normals.

## Features

- **3D Model Importation**: Supports loading of multiple 3D model formats, facilitating the integration of complex scenes and objects.
- **Mesh Data Management**: Offers robust tools for managing mesh data, ensuring efficient rendering and manipulation within the engine.

## Usage

To use the importer and mesh management module:

1. Include the header files in your rendering pipeline.
2. Utilize the importer to load 3D model files into your application.
3. Manage mesh data using the provided interfaces for optimized rendering.
