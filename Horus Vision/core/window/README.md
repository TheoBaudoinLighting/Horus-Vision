# Window Management in Horus Vision

## Overview

The `hrs_window.h` and `hrs_window.cpp` files are integral to the Horus Vision project, handling the creation and management of application windows. These files facilitate user interaction with the graphical interface and are essential for rendering scenes within the application.

## Features

- **Window Initialization**: Set up and configure windows with customizable dimensions and properties.
- **Event Handling**: Process user input and system events to respond to actions like resizing, closing, or keyboard and mouse input.
- **Rendering Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with the rendering engine to display graphical content.

## Usage

Incorporate these files into your project to manage application windows. Initialize the window system at application startup, and utilize event handling to create interactive and responsive graphical applications.

## Integration Example

```cpp
#include "hrs_window.h"

// Initialize window
Window myWindow;
myWindow.create("Horus Vision Application", 1280, 720);

// Main application loop
while(myWindow.isOpen()) {
    myWindow.processEvents();
    // Rendering and update logic here
}
