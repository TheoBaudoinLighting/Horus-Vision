# Material and Material Editor Module for Horus Vision

This module encompasses the core functionalities for managing materials in the Horus Vision rendering engine, providing interfaces for material properties, editing capabilities, and graph-based material configurations.

## Module Overview

- `hrs_material.cpp` & `hrs_material.h`: Implement the material system, defining properties such as color, texture, and reflectivity, essential for realistic rendering.
- `hrs_material_editor.cpp` & `hrs_material_editor.h`: Provide the functionality for a user interface to edit material properties dynamically, enhancing the development workflow.
- `hrs_graph.h`: Supports graph-based configurations for materials, allowing complex material behaviors and relationships to be defined with ease.

## Features

- **Dynamic Material Management**: Supports creation and real-time editing of material properties.
- **Graph-Based Configurations**: Enables advanced material setups through a graph-based interface, facilitating intricate material effects.
- **Material Editor Interface**: Offers a GUI for material property adjustments, streamlining the design and development process.

## Usage

To integrate the material and material editor modules into your project:

1. Include the respective header files in your rendering or UI components.
2. Utilize the material system to define and apply materials to rendering objects.
3. Employ the material editor for in-application editing of material properties.
4. Leverage graph-based material configurations for advanced material effects.

## Support

For detailed documentation on each function and class, refer to the inline comments within the source files. Should you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the material system or editor, please open an issue on GitHub or contact the project maintainer directly. Your contributions and inquiries are crucial for the continuous improvement of Horus Vision.
