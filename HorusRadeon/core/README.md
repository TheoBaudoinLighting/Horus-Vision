# Radeon Rendering Module for Horus Vision

This directory focuses on the integration of Radeon-specific features into Horus Vision, enhancing the rendering capabilities with advanced post-effects, optimized rendering paths, and direct support for Radeon GPUs.

## Module Overview

### Radeon Core (`hrs_radeon.h`, `hrs_radeon.cpp`)

- **Functionality**: Establishes the core Radeon support within Horus Vision, including initialization of Radeon-specific settings, and defines the base functionalities needed for Radeon-powered rendering.
- **Usage**: Core setup for projects aiming to leverage Radeon GPUs for rendering, ensuring optimal compatibility and performance.

### Radeon Post-Effects (`hrs_radeon_posteffect.cpp`, `hrs_radeon_posteffect.h`)

- **Functionality**: Implements post-rendering effects specifically optimized for Radeon hardware. This includes but is not limited to color grading, bloom, and anti-aliasing effects, enhancing the visual output of the rendering process.
- **Usage**: Integrate these files to add post-effects to your rendering pipeline, configurable to match your project's aesthetic needs.

### Radeon Rendering (`hrs_radeon_render.cpp`, `hrs_radeon_render.h`)

- **Functionality**: Contains the implementation of the rendering process tailored to Radeon architecture. It optimizes scene drawing, lighting calculations, and other rendering tasks for Radeon GPUs.
- **Usage**: Use these components to manage and execute the rendering pipeline in a Radeon-optimized environment.

## Integration

To utilize the Radeon Rendering Module in your project:

1. Include the necessary header files in your application's rendering engine.
2. Instantiate and configure the core Radeon support and post-effects as required by your application.
3. Integrate the Radeon rendering process into your main rendering loop, ensuring that Radeon optimizations are leveraged.
